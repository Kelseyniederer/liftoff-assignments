# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My application is called Loan Buddy. It is a tool that shows buyers a side by side comparison of their home loan options so that they can pick the mortgage that works best for them. Users will be prompted to input some information about themselves and the home they are looking to buy. After submitting this form the app will render an overview of their loan options for that given property. This allows users to directly compare the details, costs, funds needed to close, monthly payments, and return on investment(s) from a 5 year lookback, and then a lifetime lookback. The intention of this tool is to help buyers really understand their options when it comes to picking a home loan, and allows lenders/loan officers to be transparent with their borrowers. 

This idea came from my mom. She is a mortgage lender and created an Excel spreadsheet that has this same function, so for my project I would like to turn her spreadsheet into a fully functioning web application.

### Features
Include Features here
This application will have a login feature with an Email and password. It will have the side by side loan comparison feature, and a feature that sends a summary of the users loan options to their email address. I'm also planning on using API to autogenerate changing interest rates and property taxes.

### Technologies
Include Technologies here
I will primarily be using Java, SpringBoot, ThymeLeaf, Hibernate, and MySQL for the database. I may also use some JavaScript/TypeScript on the front end.

### What I'll Have to Learn
Include what you will need to learn here
I think the main learning curve will be creating a tool for an industry I don't know a lot about. I have access to an expert that can help me really understand the process. I would like to work for a consultant company, so I think this project will allow me to practice learning enough about a new industry so that I can make tools, and working with a non-technical person to build something new.
